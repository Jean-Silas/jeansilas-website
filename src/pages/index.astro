                    Hi.<br />I'm JS.
                </h2>
                <p>I'm technically a techical artist. Sorta.</p>
                <p>
                    I wear hats with titles like "Pipeline Architect" and "ArtOps Engineer." I make
                    the glue that helps studios manage complex asset production pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More specifically, I specialize in helping folks outside the gaming industry
                    integrate technologies like <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> and
                    <strong>Blender</strong> into their media pipelines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That means I frequently work with architects, video production companies,
                    internal corporate media teams, and indie livestreaming productions.

                <h2>Projects I'm Excited About</h2>
                <p>
                    As a part of bootstrapping my studio
                    <strong>Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Syndicate</strong>, I'm also spinning up
                    a knowledgebase and learning platform (tentatively) called the <strong>Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Archive</strong
                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My intent in creating the <strong>W<HL>L</HL>A</strong>
                     is to collect all of the common resources I point my clients to into a platform
                    that makes technical information a lot easier to digest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And to have some fun with Astro, because I'm physically incapable of staying in
                    my lane.

                <h2>How to Work With Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm still in the process of establishing a proper outsourcing and consulting
                    studio,
                    <strong>Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Syndicate</strong>, for working with
                    teams outside of my personal network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the meantime, if we have friends in common, please feel free to reach out
