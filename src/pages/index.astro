							Hi.<br />I'm JS.
						</h2>
						<p>I'm technically a techical artist. Sorta.</p>
						<p>
							I wear hats with titles like "Pipeline Architect" and "ArtOps Engineer." I make the
							glue that helps studios manage complex asset production pipelines.
						</p>
						<p>
							More specifically, I specialize in helping folks outside the gaming industry
							integrate technologies like <strong>Unreal Engine</strong> and
							<strong>Blender</strong> into their media pipelines.
						</p>
						<p>
							That means I frequently work with architects, video production companies, internal
							corporate media teams, and indie livestreaming productions.
						</p>

						<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">Projects I'm Excited About</h2>
						<p>
							As a part of bootstrapping my studio
							<span class="font-bold">Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Syndicate</span>, I'm also spinning up a
							knowledgebase and learning platform (tentatively) called the <span class="font-bold"
								>Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Archive</span
							>.
						</p>
						<p>
							My intent in creating the <span class="font-bold">W<HL>L</HL>A</span>
							 is to collect all of the common resources I point my clients to into a platform
							that makes technical information a lot easier to digest.
						</p>
						<p>
							And to have some fun with Astro, because I'm physically incapable of staying in my
							lane.

						<h2 class="mb-3 text-3xl">How to Work With Me</h2>
						<p>
							I'm still in the process of establishing a proper outsourcing and consulting studio,
							<span class="font-bold">Wise<HL>Lich</HL> Syndicate</span>, for working with teams
							outside of my personal network.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the meantime, if we have friends in common, please feel free to reach out through
