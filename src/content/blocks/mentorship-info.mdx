# Expectations

If you can learn it from Youtube, go learn it from Youtube.
If you can learn it from the documentation, go learn it from the documentation.
**My focus is on helping people develop strategic decision-making skills, not intro-level instruction.**

I expect the people I mentor to actively self-educate between meetings.
This is so we can use our hands-on time to go over the things that _don't_ fit into your typical tutorial or class — the contextual, big-picture, decision making that comes up when you have to apply your skills and knowledge to _real_ projects.

In terms of specific software and tools, though, my expectations are fairly simple.
You'll need:

1. A real text editor.
    - Rider, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, NeoVim, Emacs — show up with something suitable for reading and writing code.
2. Software for asset editing.
    - I don't care if you're using Maya and Substance Painter or Blender and Krita. Software for editing 2D and 3D assets are a bare minimum. A proper Photoshop equivalent is highly recommended.
3. Something for screen sharing.
    - I don't care if we use Google Meet, Zoom, Discord, Teamviewer, Parsec, or Jitsi. We just need something that'll let us work hands-on.
4. Some kind of Version Control.
    - I don't care if it's Git, SVN, or Perforce. I don't care if it's connected to Github, Azure DevOps, or a box in your basement. Just have _something._

While there are some programs I strongly recommend (PureRef, Excalidraw, Flameshot,
Obisian/Trilium, Figma, etc.), I don't expect everyone to show up with those programs
pre-installed and ready to go.
