# Hi. I'm JS.

I'm technically a technical artist. Sorta.

I wear hats with titles like "Pipeline Architect" and "ArtOps Engineer." 
I make the glue that helps studios manage complex asset production pipelines.

More specifically, I specialize in helping folks outside the gaming industry integrate technologies like **Unreal Engine** and **Blender** into their media pipelines.

That means I frequently work with architects, video production companies, internal corporate media teams, and indie livestreaming productions.

## Projects I'm excited about

As a part of bootstrapping my studio, The Wise Lich Syndicate, I'm also spinning up a knowledgebase and learning platform (tentatively) called **The Wise Lich Archive.**

My intent with the WLA is to collect all of the common resource I point my clients to into a platform that makes technical information *significantly* easier to digest.

And to have some fun with Astro, because I'm fundamentally incapable of staying in my lane.

## How to Work With Me

I'm still in the process of setting up proper infrastructure for *external* consulting and outsourcing.
In the meantime, if we have friends in common, please feel free to reach out through the scheduling link below.
