# Hi. I'm JS.

I'm technically a technical artist. Sorta.

I wear hats with titles like "Pipeline Architect" and "ArtOps Engineer."
I make the glue that helps studios manage complex asset production pipelines.

More specifically, I specialize in helping folks outside the gaming industry integrate technologies like **Unreal Engine** and **Blender** into their media pipelines.

That means I frequently work with architects, video production companies, internal corporate media teams, and indie livestreaming productions.

## Projects I'm excited about

My big project right now is the [Semantically Anchored Paths](https://github.com/Jean-Silas/SemanticallyAnchoredPaths-Specification) specification, which is a fancy URI format for file paths that are relative to arbitrary 'anchor' directories.
If the idea of being able to treat your local file system as an asset server sounds appealing, go check out the [overview page](sap) 

## How to Work With Me

I'm still in the process of setting up proper infrastructure for _external_ consulting and outsourcing.
In the meantime, if we have friends in common, please feel free to reach out through the scheduling link below.
