# Semantically Anchored Paths

My current 'big project' is an [open specification](https://github.com/Jean-Silas/SemanticallyAnchoredPaths-Specification) for URIs that are relative to hierarchies of 'semantically significant' directories in the local file system, which are discoverable by crawling the file system for configuration files.

The basic idea is create a generic way to express project-relative paths that can handle arbitrarily deep hierarchies (e.g. projects inside projects), can be reasonably integrated into artist-facing systems in gaming and VFX, and can be used for both asset references and configuration references.

Without relying on environment variables, asset servers, or any kind of external process.

## The SAP URI Scheme in a Nutshell

```diagram 
     ┌─ Anchor                                   
    ┌┴─┐                           
sap:proj::PreViz.Reference//scale_ref/human/tall.usd
└┬┘       └──────┬───────┘  └──────────┬───────────┘
 └─ Scheme       └─ Namespace          └─ Path
```

1. The `Scheme` segment is what makes it a URI. 
   - SAP stands for Semantically Anchored Path.
2. The `Anchor` segment indicates the *kind* of directory to ascend to. 
   - A directory is anchored by putting a `.dirconf.[anchor].json` file inside it. The anchor is included in the file name so that simple paths (ones without namespaces) can be resolved without opening and parsing the file.
   - There are seven anchors in the spec (see table), specifically to support both shot-, scene-, and sequence-relative paths *inside* projects and flexibly arranged shared resources and dependencies *outside* projects.
3. The `Namespace` segment is an optional segment that's resolved by reading the namespace dictionary inside the configuration file.
4. The `Path` segment is resolved as a normal path.


| Anchor | Name         |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `org`  | Organization |
| `dept` | Department   |
| `work` | Workspace    |
| `proj` | Project      |
| `lib`  | Library      |
| `kit`  | Kit          |
| `pkg`  | Package      |

The information above isn't enough to count as a proper, formal, specification, but it should give you a decent bird's eye view.

## But... Why?

Our IDE's support multi-root workspaces and per-project configuration.
We prioritize making our programmer-facing tools (relatively) portable and (relatively) easy to deploy.
We've created ecosystems of tools and frameworks let students and juniors learn and experiment with scaled-down versions of enterprise-sized tools.

But we don't do any of that for artists.

The DCCs we give our artists aren't IDE-like; they have fistfuls of brittle environment variables and all too frequently require destructive script-based configuration management for what *should be* simple, static, per-project configurations.
The assumption that artists use studio-managed workstations is deeply engrained into every tool we give them.

And if we want to fix that at-scale, the first thing we need is a generalized solution for file path wrangling that isn't tied to a specific DCC or game engine.
Something that doesn't require environment variables, where all you need to do is pull a git repo.
