# Atomic Design: Random Number Generators as "Fucky Dice"

<Callout kind="summary">
    Modeling random number generators as "fucky dice" can be a great design strategy.
    
    Each set of dice comes with both a statistical distribution and a level of numerical granularity that will inform later design decisions you make.
    Your dice will influence your modifiers, your modifiers will influence your value scaling, your value scaling will influence your loot design, and so on.
</Callout>

I'm going to make a pitch that will sound either incredibly weird or totally self-evident:

1. You should treat random number generation as a concrete, intentional, part of your design system.
2. Modeling your **Generators** as "fucky dice" can be an intuitive way to enforce certain statistical distributions in an error-resistant way.
3. Taking the time to build visualizers for your "fucky dice" and how they interact with your other atomic design elements can help you catch flaws in your value scaling.

Now I'll be the first to say that my approach to game mechanics has heavy tabletop influences.
I will always advocate for hand-calculable, integer-based, systems with relatively simple rules.
It's how I'm built.

This notion of "fucky dice" isn't *just* me thumping on about tabletop things, though.
It's about setting up design tools that help you make better decisions throughout the entire design process.

## What do Generators *do?*

A Generator, on its own, isn't a complete game mechanic.
All it does is produce values, that belong to a particular set, with some knowable statistical distribution.

This means that even a language-default `rand()` function counts as a Generator if you're consciously using it as part of your design process.
An even distribution of floats in the `0..1` range can quite useful when you use it intentionally.

The thing is, you rarely use `rand()` on its own in game mechanics.
You rescale the results to a different range, maybe add a distribution bias, and _then_ use it as a Generator.
Sometimes you do this as a forward-looking design decision, but a lot of the time you do it reactively, driven by feeling or feedback.

And that's crux of generators:

<Callout kind="info">
    Generators produce values, that belong to particular sets, with knowable statistical distributions, **and reinforce subjective impressions about the mechanics they're used in.**

## How Dice Work

The wonderful thing about normal dice is that they're intuitive.
If you roll a normal four sided die it'll produce a value in the `1..=4` range with an even distribution and a mean of two and a half.
If you roll two four sided dice and add them together, they'll give you something in `2..=8` with a symmetrically curved distribution, where both the mean and most common result is five.
If you roll more, the curve becomes more pronounced in a predictable way.

Here are some charts, just for the sake of thoroughness:

<TabbedChartGroup tabs={["1d4", "2d4", "3d4"]} group_name="d4s" label="Standard d4's">
    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice="1d4" complex={false} norm={50}>
            The standard `1d4` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice="2d4" complex={false} norm={50}>
            The standard `2d4` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice="3d4" complex={false} norm={50}>
            The standard `3d4` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

</TabbedChartGroup>

But we're not here for normal dice, we're here for _fucky_ dice.
We're here to use the approachability of low-value integer ranges as a stepping stone into conversations about the utility of certain statistical distributions in game design.

So lets start off with something simple:

### What if dice had zeros and repeated numbers?

This is the distribution you get if you roll a twenty-one-sided die that has one zero, two ones, three twos, four threes, five fours, and six fives:

<TabbedChartGroup tabs={["One Die", "Two Dice", "Three Dice"]} group_name="lin_expansion" label="Linearly Expanding Value Repetition">
    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap((val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}
            >
            The `1d[(0..=5)*($i+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `2d[(0..=5)*($i+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index + 1).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `2d[(0..=5)*($i+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>
</TabbedChartGroup>

Now here's a die with one zero, two ones, five twos, ten threes, seventeen fours, and twenty-six fives:

<TabbedChartGroup tabs={["One Die", "Two Dice", "Three Dice"]} group_name="exp_expansion" label="Exponentially Expanding Value Repetition">
    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
                
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `1d[(0..=5)*(($i^2)+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `2d[(0..=5)*(($i^2)+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(index * index + 1).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `3d[(0..=5)*(($i^2)+1)]` distribution
        </DiceChart>
    </TabChartWrapper>
</TabbedChartGroup>

Isn't that _fun?_

They're simple offset exponential distributions with discrete values.
The offset peaks for the summed rolls scale exactly as you'd expect them to.
There's nothing fancy here, and you probably already have the libraries needed to implement it.

And in term of practical benefits, there are _tons._

Now here's what you get with a powers-of-two repetition:

<TabbedChartGroup tabs={["One Die", "Two Dice", "Three Dice"]} group_name="pow2" label="Powers-of-Two Dice">
    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val))),
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={60}>
            The `1d[(0..=5)*(2^$i)]` distribution
        </DiceChart >
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val)))
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `2d[(0..=5)*(2^$i)]` distribution
        </DiceChart >
    </TabChartWrapper>

    <TabChartWrapper>
        <DiceChart dice={[
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val))),
                [0,1,2,3,4,5].flatMap( (val, index) => (Array(2**index).fill(val)))
            ]}
            complex={true}
            norm={50}>
            The `2d[(0..=5)*(2^$i)]` distribution
        </DiceChart >
    </TabChartWrapper>
</TabbedChartGroup>
