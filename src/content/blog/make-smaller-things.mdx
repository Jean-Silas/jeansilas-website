# Make Smaller Things

<Callout kind="summary">
    Every project deals with scope creep and cut features.
    Your job is to control *when* and *where* you creep and cut.
</Callout>

I don't know you.
I don't know what you're working on.
I don't know your skill level, resources, timeline, or budget.

Your project is too big.

Or, rather, it's the wrong kind of big.
