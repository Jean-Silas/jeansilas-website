## 2025-03-07: Names should be written backwards

Not literally backwards — conceptually backwards.
Asset names in gaming often use some kind of `bigGroup_smallGroup_identity_variant` pattern.
They refine downwards from broad labels to specific labels.

But when you sit down to make an asset, `prop_furn_kitchenTable_clean` begins its life as that specific variant.
You make a clean kitchen table, something that fits the fullfills the descriptive portion of the name,
and then you run it through your pipeline to transform it, encapsulate it, and publish it as something that fulfills the categorical potion of the name.
You start with a table and end with a prop.

And just to be clear, I'm not saying that `clean_kitchenTable_furn_prop` is a better name than `prop_furn_kitchenTable_clean` 
— I'm saying that we should build the name `prop_furn_kitchenTable_clean` by prepending labels to righthand descriptive portion, the same way you build the
asset itself by prepending layers of descriptive data to a payload of art.
